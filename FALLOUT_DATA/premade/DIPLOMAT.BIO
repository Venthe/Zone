CHITSA'S STORY:

Chitsa has always been
able to convince others
to do things her way.
Her winning personality
and stunning good looks,
have often caused others 
to underestimate the 
tribe's best trader.
In the course of her
frequent journeys,
Chitsa has learned to
deal with the perils of
travelling the Wastes.
Now the tribe needs help
and new paths beckon to
Chitsa.
